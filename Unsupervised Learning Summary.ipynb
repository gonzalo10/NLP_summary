    "Now this, in my opinion, is the newest and most novel approach we've discussed here. The high level approach is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Cleaning -> Encoder/Decoder -> K Means Clustering -> Extract Sentences Closest to Cluster Center\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are two main concepts I want to discuss before jumping into the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip Thought Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use a encoder/decoder framework to generate feature vectors Taking it from Kushal Chauhan's post, here is how the encoder and decoder layers are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder Network: The encoder is typically a GRU-RNN which generates a fixed length vector representation h(i) for each sentence S(i) in the input. The encoded representation h(i) is obtained by passing final hidden state of the GRU cell (i.e. after it has seen the entire sentence) to multiple dense layers.\n",
    "Decoder Network: The decoder network takes this vector representation h(i) as input and tries to generate two sentences - S(i-1) and S(i+1), which could occur before and after the input sentence respectively. Separate decoders are implemented for generation of previous and next sentences, both being GRU-RNNs. The vector representation h(i) acts as the initial hidden state for the GRUs of the decoder networks.\n",
    "Similar to how Word2Vec embeddings are trained by predicting the surrounding words, the Skip Thought Vectors are trained by predicting the sentence at time, t-1 and t+1. As this model is trained, the learned representation (hidden layer) will now place similar sentences closer together which enables higher performance clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to review the paper on the same subject for more clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you will be familiar with this form of unsupervised learning but I want to elaborate on how it is used and why it is interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are aware, each cluster will have some center point which, in the vector space, would indicate the point which closely represents the theme of that cluster. With this in mind, when trying to create a summary, we should only need the sentence which is the closest to the center of that cluster. The key here is choosing the correct number of clusters to do a good job of summarizing the content. Kushal's post recommends that we calculate the cluster size by taking 30% of the number of sentences."

    "\n",
    "But relaxation has its limits. At some point all that Chilling Out fades its way into Complacency, and our natural Human nature starts to work against us, telling us to conserve energy and not really do much of anything. And laziness begets more laziness, and life actually becomes less fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this effect in our activities. I’ve only completed two blog posts over the entire summer holidays, and together we have put out only two YouTube videos. Spending more time at home and less at the MMM Headquarters squat rack has caused me to lose at least five pounds of leg muscle that I had wanted to keep. Little MM has spent a lot less time practicing on the upright bass and putting out songs, and a lot more time playing video games and getting sucked into the “dank memes” and “Trove” channels on Reddit.\n",

    "This laziness was affecting my financial life, and your financial life too. I had let thousands of dollars of uninvested cash build up in my checking account, where it was sitting around earning nothing. My credit card bills had come in, been automatically paid, and filed themselves away without me even reviewing them for fraudulent transactions or wussypants spending on my part. And I had a growing mini-mountain of things I need to do regarding insurance, accounting, and legal stuff in both my personal and business domains.\n",

    "For example, just recently a coworking member came to me and asked for some financial help. And as always, I suggested we start by looking at big recurring expenses.

    "So, right there we did a quick round of phone calls and online quotes, and streamlined a bit of the insurance coverage by increasing the deductibles. Within 90 minutes (she did most of the work while I had a beer and swept the floors of the HQ), we had the following new set of options:\n",

    "Subaru liability coverage: $380 per year ($200 savings) through Geico\n",

    "New total expenses: $12,502 ($6363 per year in savings!!)\n",

My friend just did two hours of work in total while drinking a glass of wine,  and dropped her annual expenses by over $500 per month, or six thousand dollars per year.

    "The Council would meet every now and then to talk through life’s biggest expenses and opportunities, and harvest the wisdom of the group so we can all benefit from the best ideas in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response to this idea was overwhelmingly positive. So we called a first “test” meeting earlier this month and a small group of us talked through the first few categories, sharing not just names like “I use Schmidt Insurance”, but details like, “We have $250,000 coverage with a $1,000 deductible and our premium is $589 per year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The meeting was so lively that we quickly ran out of time, but resolved to meet again soon to figure out more things together. I served as the scribe using a shared google doc – here’s a snapshot of that to give you an idea of our topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "So Yes. There is some thinking and work involved. But there’s also an opportunity to drastically improve your short term cashflow and long-term wealth, and break your friends out of their cautious shell to help them get the same benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned long ago in Protecting your Money Mustache from Spendy Friends, most people tend towards complacency, and following along with the group. Which leaves a big gaping void at the top of the pyramid where the leadership role waits unfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are bold enough to climb into this spot (which really means just sending a few emails and Facebook messages, procuring a box or two of wine, and making a large tray of high-end nachos for your guests), you can all reap the rewards for decades to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "And instead of avoiding this little chore like a hassle, dive into it like a gigantic shower of fun and wealth. After all, this is pretty much the core attitude of Mustachianism Itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the comments: we can start our own Optimization Council right here. If you have found a good deal on any of the categories of life, feel free to share a quick summary of your location (state), and details of the company and product/service/price that you found is the best. To avoid spam filtering, please use names but not direct links.\n",

    "A Note about Credible:\n",
    "\n",
    "Watchful readers may have noticed I also mentioned this company on Twitter recently. After a few months of skepticism that the world needed yet another financial company, I was convinced by some conversations with the people running it and a Zoom video of the customer experience from a senior employee, with some very candid commentary on their design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like it because they import the lending models from their large supply of hooked-up finance companies, then run the rate comparisons on their own server rather than farming out your personal information to each separate lender. It saves you from filling out multiple applications when collecting rates, and also saves you from getting on everyone’s spam list (they don’t sell your contact information, which is a rare thing among loan search engines).\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a hard model for them to get going, because the banks naturally want to have your information so they can spam you.  But now that they have a growing presence in the market, lenders are forced to come through Credible to get access to this pool of qualified people. After enough testing with people I knew, I found the experience is worth recommending.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I also signed this blog up with their referral program  – please see my Affiliates philosophy if you are curious or skeptical about how any of that works!\n",
